# TypingSpeedTest
This Javascript application tests your typing speed. User goal is to duplicate the text provided in grey, exactly the way it is written. The timer starts when the user starts typing, and only stops when the text matches exactly. Clear clears the text and the user can start again. Copy paste doesn't work.
